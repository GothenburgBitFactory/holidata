.SH NAME
clog \- colorized log filter

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B clog [<options>] [<section> ...]

  -h|--help       Show this usage
  -v|--version    Show this version
  -d|--date       Prepend all lines with the current date
  -t|--time       Prepend all lines with the current time
  -f|--file       Override default ~/.clogrc

.SH DESCRIPTION
Clog is a filter command, and therefore copies its input to its output.  But if
lines in the input match certain patterns, actions are taken, which are defined
as 'rules'.

The rules are defined in ~/.clogrc as text patterns or regular expressions, and
the actions are specified, to colorize either the line or matching pattern, or
perhaps to suppress the line.

If --date is specified the current date, YYYY-MM-DD, is prepended to all lines.

If --time is specified the current time, HH:MM:SS, is prepended to all lines.

If --file is specified, an alternate configuration rc file may be specified.
Default is to ~/.clogrc

One or more section arguments may be specified.  If none are provided, 'default'
is assumed.  A section corresponds to a named rule set defined in ~/.clogrc. and
allows the use of one .clogrc file to serve multiple different uses of clog.
If more than one section is specified, the rules sets are combined, in the
sequence found.

.SH CONFIGURATION FILE AND OVERRIDE OPTIONS
Clog reads its configuration from a file in the user's home directory:
~/.clogrc.

The configuration file can include other configuration files, using this syntax:

.RS
include /path/to/other/file
.br
include ~/rules.txt
.RE

The format of the rules is:

.RS
<section> rule /<pattern>/ --> <color> <action>
.br
<section> rule "<pattern>" --> <color> <action>
.RE

If the pattern is surrounded by / characters, it is interpreted as a regular
expression.  If the pattern is surrounded by " characters, it is interpreted as
a string fragment.

The section is simply a way to allow multiple rules sets, so that one .clogrc
file can serve multiple uses.  The pattern may be any supported Standard C
Library regular expression.  Action must be one of 'line', 'match', 'suppress'
or 'blank'.

Note that there is a default section, called 'default'.  Putting rules in the
default section means that no section need be specified on the command line.

Any color can be used, in both the 16- and 256-color space.  Some examples are:

.RS
bold
.br
underline
.br
bold blue
.br
underline on green
.br
black on white
.br
bold red on bright white
.br
rgb200 on grey4
.RE

Instead of coloring the whole line, specifying 'match' instead will only color
the parts of the line that match.

.SH EXAMPLE Rulesets
Here is an example ~/.clogrc file.

.RS
# Standard syslog entries.
.br
default rule /warn|debug/   --> yellow line
.br
default rule /error|severe/ --> red line
.br
default rule /critical/     --> bold red line
.br
default rule /critical/     --> blank
.br
default rule /ignore/       --> suppress
.br

.br
# Apache access.log status codes
.br
apache rule / 2[0-9][0-9] / --> green match
.br
apache rule / 3[0-9][0-9] / --> yellow match
.br
apache rule / 4[0-9][0-9] / --> red match
