Installation Instructions
-------------------------

Please follow the instructions below to build holidata with cmake.


Pre-requisites
--------------

You will need the 'cmake' build system installed in order to build holidata
from source.

More information on cmake can be obtained at http://cmake.org


Basic Installation
------------------

Briefly, these shell commands will unpack, build and install holidata:

  $ tar xzf holidata-1.0.0.tar.gz                 [1]
  $ cd holidata-1.0.0                             [2]
  $ cmake .                                       [3]
  $ make                                          [4]
  $ make test                                     [5]
  $ sudo make install                             [6]
  $ cd .. ; rm -r holidata-1.0.0                  [7]

These commands are explained below:

  1. Unpacks the source tarball.  This creates the directory holidata-1.0.0,
     containing all the code.

  2. Change directory to the root of the distribution.

  3. Invokes cmake to scan for dependencies and machine-specific details, then
     generate the makefiles.  This may take a minute.

  4. Builds holidata.  This may take a minute.

  5. Optional step that runs the unit tests.  On completion, will report the
     number of passing and failing tests.  There should be zero failing tests.
     If you see failing tests, please report this.

  6. Installs the program, documentation and other data files.

  7. Removes the temporary directory.


Uninstallation
--------------

To uninstall holidata, you need the Makefiles, so if you deleted them in step 7
above, they must first be regenerated by following steps [1], [2] and [3].  Then
simply run:

  $ sudo make uninstall TODO TODO TODO -- cmake doesn't include uninstall


Holidata Build Notes
----------------

Holidata has dependencies that are detected by cmake in almost all cases, but there
are situations and operating systems that mean you will need to offer a little help.

If holidata will not build on your system, first take a look at the Operating System
notes below.  If this doesn't help, then go to the Troubleshooting section,
which includes instructions on how to contact us for help.
