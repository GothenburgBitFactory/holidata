# I have not checked every province and territory website, but the wikipedia
# summary has been true for everything that I have checked, although it seems
# to be considering more holidays than the bare minimum and also counts holidays
# that are not mandated but usually observed (e.g. St-Patrick's Day in NL which
# is not statutory, but is given to government employees).
